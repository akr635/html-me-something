    <p>In the summer of 2010, I studied abroad in South Africa.
    I spent the majority of my summer in Cape Town.</p>

    <p>Getting to South Africa was an experience in and of itself. First,
        some friends and I took a Greyhound bus from St. Louis to Chicago.
        In Chicago, we boarded a flight to Paris. We spent 10+ hours exploring
        Paris during our layover. Finally, we flew to Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
    <p>While in Cape Town, I studied comparative law alongside South African
        law students. We focused on constitional law, criminal justice, and
        dispute resolution.</p>
    <p>I had many remarkable experiences while in South Africa.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cage diving with great white sharks</li>
            <li>Visiting Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned</li>
            <li>Week-long safari in Kruger National Park</li>
        </ul>
